could enumerate each number i in the sequence, and use the number as the root, then, the subsequence 1 ... (i-1) 
on its left side would lay on the left branch of the root, and similarly the right subsequence (i+1) ... n 
lay on the right branch of the root. We then can construct the subtree from the subsequence recursively. 
Through the above approach, we could be assured that the BST that we construct are all unique, 
since they start from unique roots.

As we can see, the problem can be reduced into problems with smaller sizes, 
instead of recursively (also repeatedly) solve the subproblems, 
we can store the solution of subproblems and reuse them later, i.e. the dynamic programming way.


 
# dp
# dp[i]: num of unique BST's (binary search trees) that store values 1 ... n == number of unique BST for a sequence of length n.


# time O(n^2)
# space O(n)


class Solution(object):
    def numTrees(self, n):
        
        if n == 0 or n == 1:
            return 1
        
        dp = [0 for i in range(n + 1)] # num of unique BST with n diff notes
        dp[0] = dp[1] = 1
        
        for i in range(2, len(dp)):
            for j in range(0, i): # num of unique BST with j notes for left subtree
                dp[i] = dp[i] + dp[j] * dp[i - 1 - j] # we take i as root
        return dp[-1]
