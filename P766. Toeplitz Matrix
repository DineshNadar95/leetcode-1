No online judge for the follow-up questions so let's discuss:
1. What if the matrix is stored on disk, and the memory is limited such that 
you can only load at most one row of the matrix into the memory at once?

For the follow-up 1, we are only able to load one row at one time, 
so we have to use a buffer (1D data structure) to store the row info. 
When next row comes as a streaming flow, we can compare each value (say, matrix[i][j], i>=1, j>=1) 
to the "upper-left" value in the buffer (buffer[j - 1]); 
meanwhile, we update the buffer by inserting the 1st element of the current row (matrix[i][0]) 
to buffer at position 0 (buffer[0]), and removing the last element in the buffer.

2. What if the matrix is so large that you can only load up a partial row into the memory at once?

For the follow-up 2, we can only load a partial row at one time.
We could split the whole matrix vertically into several sub-matrices,
while each sub-matrix should have one column overlapped. 
We repeat the same method in follow-up 1 for each sub-matrix.
