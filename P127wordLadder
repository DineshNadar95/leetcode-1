BFS

# time O(m*m*n) # m is length of words, n is word numbers, m * n possible words, and takes m to get each new word
# space O(m * n)

time : where M is the length of words and N is the total number of words in the input word list. 
Finding out all the transformations takes M iterations for each of the N words. 
Also, breadth first search in the worst case might go to each of the N words.

space : to store all M transformations for each of the N words, 
in the all_combo_dict dictionary. Visited dictionary is of N size. 
Queue for BFS in worst case would need space for all N words.
