The first loop is to exclude n - 1 labels that are not possible to be a celebrity.
After the first loop, x is the only candidate.
The second and third loop is to verify x is actually a celebrity by definition.

# time O(n)

class Solution(object):
    def findCelebrity(self, n):
        # find celebrity
        celebrity = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if knows(celebrity, i):
                celebrity = i
               
        # verify celebrity
        for i in range(n):
            if celebrity != i:
                if knows(celebrity, i):
                    return -1
                if not knows(i, celebrity):
                    return -1
                
        return celebrity
